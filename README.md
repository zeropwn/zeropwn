## Introduction
Iâ€™m a 22 year old security consultant and researcher. I specialize in web-app security and backend / API development. I have helped a wide variety of organizations secure their systems over the course of approximately 7 years. Some of these include: Internet Service Providers & Electronic Medical Software vendors, open source projects. My main focus is to report critical vulnerabilities in software/hardware before malicious adversaries have the opportunity to exploit them.
